# Axis

Every series on the chart registers themselves to an axis. Axes are used to group series together on a scale. By default, all series use the same axis and place themselves on the chart aligned to a single scale.

Series components accept the `axisId` prop that is used to register themselves to an axis. The default `axisId` for every series is `'0'`.

## Single axis

Here is a chart with three series that all use the same axis scale:

<ExampleWrapper codeSnippets={[{
  name: 'Tailwind',
  files: [
    {
      fileName: 'index.tsx',
      slotName: 'tailwindTsx',
    }
  ]
}]} height={302} client:idle>
  <SingleAxisExample client:only />
  <RawCode slot="tailwindTsx" code={SingleAxisExampleTsx} lang="tsx" />
</ExampleWrapper>

While this makes sense for some charts, you might want to split the series up into multiple series to ensure better readability.

## Multiple axes

The example above had one series with much higher values than the others. This can lead to a chart that is hard to read. Lets solve this by creating a seperate axis scale for the series with the high numbers:

<ExampleWrapper codeSnippets={[{
  name: 'Tailwind',
  files: [
    {
      fileName: 'index.tsx',
      slotName: 'tailwindTsx',
    }
  ]
}]} height={302} client:idle>
  <MultipleAxisExample client:only />
  <RawCode slot="tailwindTsx" code={MultipleAxisExampleTsx} lang="tsx" />
</ExampleWrapper>

The axis labels on the right now correspond with the high value series, which improves the scaling of the other axis and makes reading the chart easier.
